# Aquarium Water Testing App
The water parameters are a crucial aspect of an aquarium. Parameters such as water pH, GH, KH, and ammonia levels need to be monitored in order to keep the environment safe for aquatic life. This program takes measurements stored in a database and plots them on a graph in order to visualise the change over time.

This was a project that was used to learn how to make an app with python, SQL databases, and CSS.

It uses Dash to generate a graph in order to see the changes in water parameters over time.

## App features
- Log water parameters
- Store water information in a database
- View water parameter changes over time
